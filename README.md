#Shop Management System with Inventory Management System

This is a C++ program that simulates a basic point-of-sale (POS) system for a single shop. It has two main modes: a customer mode and an admin mode.

In the customer mode, users can create an account by providing their name, phone number, and a password. They can then log in to their account, view their current credit balance, and purchase items from the shop's inventory by entering the item's number and quantity. The program will update the customer's credit balance and the shop's inventory accordingly.

In the admin mode, users with the correct password can add new items to the shop's inventory, remove existing items, update prices, and view the current inventory. The admin can also view a list of customers and their current credit balance.

The program uses arrays to store the shop's inventory, customer information, and purchased items. It also uses various control flow statements, such as if and while, to allow the user to navigate the program and perform different actions based on their input.
